# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.38.0] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- **Payment status in email summaries** — deposit amount and payment status (awaiting/deposit paid/fully paid) shown in request-received and booking-offer emails
- **Payment status on booking detail page** — customers see current payment status with color coding (gold=pending, green=paid)
- **Auto-send update email on payment** — when paymentStatus changes to deposit_paid or fully_paid, booking update email with payment status is automatically sent to customer

## [1.37.1] - 2026-03-28

### Fixed
- **Date formatting in emails** — all email templates now show dates as "3 April 2026" (EN) / "3 апреля 2026" (RU) instead of raw ISO `2026-04-03T00:00:00.000Z`. Applied to summary rows, inline text, and CMS `{date}` placeholder.

## [1.37.0] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- **CMS-editable booking summary labels** — new "Booking Summary" tab in Email Templates with 19 editable fields: row labels (Tour, Date, Time, Guests, Price, Email, Phone, Requests, Payment, Language, Reference, Deposit, Cash balance), payment method texts, and language names. All localized EN/RU with hardcoded fallbacks.

## [1.36.4] - 2026-03-28

### Changed
- **Currency formatting** — all prices now display as `4 475 CZK`, `139 EUR`, `175 USD` (value + ISO code) instead of `Kč4475`, `€139`, `$175`. Applies to emails, booking pages, tour cards, and all price displays.

## [1.36.3] - 2026-03-28

### Fixed
- **Links missing in emails** — `toEmailHtml()` link nodes were skipped because the link check ran after the children fallback. Moved link/autolink handling before text extraction so `<a href>` tags render correctly in all CMS richText email content.

## [1.36.2] - 2026-03-28

### Changed
- **No auto-send emails on admin status change** — removed auto-send for declined, cancelled, and paid status transitions from afterChange hook. Admin must use "Send Offer" / "Send Email" button manually. Stripe webhook still sends payment confirmation emails automatically.

## [1.36.1] - 2026-03-28

### Fixed
- **RichText rendering in emails** — CMS body/note fields in declined, confirmed, payment-received, and pre-tour-reminder emails now render HTML correctly instead of escaping tags as plain text. Content sourced from trusted CMS admin only.

## [1.36.0] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- **Tour name in customer's language** — new `tourName` field on BookingRequests auto-populated from tour title in customer's locale (EN/RU). Shown in admin list view so guide sees tour name in the booking language. `/api/fix-tour-names` backfills existing bookings.

## [1.35.9] - 2026-03-28

### Fixed
- **Hero scroll arrow** — scroll-down indicator on homepage now links to `#content` section with smooth scrolling

## [1.35.8] - 2026-03-28

### Fixed
- **LocalBusiness address field** — added `streetAddress` and `postalCode` to OrganizationSchema (TravelAgency) and Reviews page LocalBusiness schema. Fixes GSC "A value for the address field is required" error.

## [1.35.7] - 2026-03-28

### Fixed
- **x-default hreflang on all pages** — added `hreflang="x-default"` pointing to EN version on all static pages (homepage, tours, about, reviews, contact, FAQ, blog, legal) and blog detail pages. Fixes Google Search Console "Conflicting hreflang and rel=canonical" and "No self-referencing hreflang" errors.

## [1.35.6] - 2026-03-28

### Changed
- **Stripe payments enabled in booking form** — re-enabled credit card online payment option (was hidden during Stripe sandbox mode). Customers can now choose between cash and card payment.

## [1.35.5] - 2026-03-27

### Changed
- **301 permanent redirects** — upgraded next-intl pathname redirects from 307 (temporary) to 301 (permanent), telling search engines to permanently consolidate localized URL variants (e.g. `/ru/tours/` → `/ru/ekskursii/`)

## [1.35.4] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- **`localizeHref()` helper** — `src/i18n/routing.ts` utility that translates CMS href paths (`/tours`, `/about`, `/reviews`, `/contact`, `/faq`) to localized RU paths (`/ekskursii`, `/o-nas`, `/otzyvy`, `/kontakty`, `/voprosy`). Preserves query strings and sub-paths.

### Fixed
- **Navigation localized URLs** — Nav and Footer now use `localizeHref()` to translate CMS-stored paths for RU locale, fixing `/ru/tours/` → `/ru/ekskursii/` and all other localized paths in header links, CTA, and footer columns
- **Localized tour URLs** — all internal tour links now use `/ru/ekskursii/` instead of `/ru/tours/` for RU locale, eliminating unnecessary 307 redirects. Fixed in TourCard, FeaturedTours, TourSchema, WebSiteSchema, blog CTAs, and tour detail breadcrumbs.

## [1.35.2] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- **Gallery alt text** — `/api/fix-alt-text` now also updates `tours_gallery_locales` (the gallery `item.alt` field), which takes priority on tour detail pages over Media alt
- **x-default hreflang** — paired bilingual tours now include `hreflang="x-default"` pointing to EN version

### Changed
- **SEO alt text for tour images** — `/api/fix-alt-text` endpoint sets keyword-rich, hyphenated alt text for hero images and gallery images across all 37 tours (44 alt texts total, max 60 chars, transliterated for RU)

## [1.35.0] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- **robots.txt** — `public/robots.txt` with sitemap reference for search engine crawlers
- **WebSiteSchema** — JSON-LD WebSite schema with SearchAction now rendered on all pages (was defined but unused)
- **Keyword-optimized SEO for all 37 tours** — `/api/fix-seo-keywords` endpoint seeds meta titles with primary keywords and meta descriptions with prices for all 14 EN + 23 RU tour pages, following character limits (EN: 60/160, RU: 50/130)

### Changed
- **noIndex field rendering** — `generateMetadata()` on tour detail pages now respects the `seo.noIndex` checkbox, outputting `robots: { index: false, follow: true }` when set

## [1.34.1] - 2026-03-26

### Changed
- **Lazy loading images** — added `loading="lazy"` to below-fold images on GuideProfile, About gallery, Reviews gallery, Blog list cards, Blog detail related posts, and Blog sidebar popular posts. Removed unnecessary `priority` from GuideProfile photo (below fold). Improves initial page load and LCP.

## [1.34.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- **Stripe expired/failed payment handling** — webhook now handles `checkout.session.expired` (clears payment link, logs audit) and `payment_intent.payment_failed` (logs failure reason). New `checkout_expired` audit event type.
- **Tour review structured data** — TourSchema now includes individual `Review` items from the reviews collection for valid Google review snippets

### Changed
- **ISR enabled** — removed `force-dynamic` from tour detail, tours catalog, homepage, reviews, blog listing pages. ISR caching with `revalidate` now works, dramatically improving TTFB.
- **Structured data fixes** — changed `Product` to `TourProduct` (avoids shipping/return policy requirements), removed aggregateRating from `TouristTrip` (invalid per Google), added `priceValidUntil` to offers, added individual review items
- **Next.js Image on booking page** — replaced raw `<img>` with optimized `<Image>` component with `priority` and responsive `sizes`
- **Font optimization** — reduced Cormorant Garamond italic styles
- **Mobile UX** — safe-area insets for iPhone notch on sticky book button, larger touch targets (currency buttons, category selects, modal close button), swipe-to-dismiss on booking modal, iOS scroll lock fix

### Fixed
- **Google Search Console errors** — "Invalid object type for field", "Missing field 'review'", "Missing field 'aggregateRating'", "Missing field 'priceValidUntil'", "Missing field 'shippingDetails'" / "Missing field 'hasMerchantReturnPolicy'" (eliminated by using TourProduct instead of Product)

## [1.31.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added

Affects collections, globals, types, frontend pages, seed data, fix-schema. Schema.org keeps hardcoded coordinates for structured data.
- **Multi-currency deposit** — Stripe Checkout now uses the booking's currency (EUR/CZK/USD) instead of hardcoded EUR. `createDepositSession` accepts optional `currency` parameter.

### Fixed
- **Non-destructive fix-schema** — removed `DROP TABLE` for trust badges tables; uses `CREATE IF NOT EXISTS` only; existing CMS data survives redeployments

## [1.27.2] - 2026-03-19

## [1.26.3] - 2026-03-19 [superseded by 1.27.0]

### Fixed
- **Booking form "Failed to send"** — `specialRequests` richText field in BookingRequests received plain string from form submission, causing Payload validation error. Now converts plain text to Lexical JSON before saving (both server action and API route)
- **Contact form same issue** — `message` richText field in ContactMessages had the same plain-text-to-richText mismatch. Fixed in all 4 code paths (server action + API route, normal + rate-limited saves)
- **Trust badges show fallback when not configured** — booking trust badges displayed hardcoded defaults when no badges were set in admin. Now returns empty array so badges section is hidden unless explicitly configured in Site Settings

## [1.26.2] - 2026-03-18

## [1.26.1] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- **Reply-To on admin emails** — booking and contact admin notification emails now set Reply-To as the customer's email for direct reply from email client

### Fixed
- **Payment Settings save error** — `payment_config` table was missing in production; added correct Payload-native schema (main table + enum + cash_currencies sub-table) to fix-schema endpoint
- **Email Templates save error** — `email_templates` schema had localized columns on main table instead of `_locales` table; recreated with exact Payload-native schema (non-localized `admin_subject` on main, all localized fields on `_locales`)
- **CSP blocks Umami script** — added `https://analytics.bestpragueguide.com` to Content-Security-Policy `script-src` directive; was present in `connect-src` but missing from `script-src`

## [1.26.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- **CMS-managed email templates** — new `EmailTemplates` global in Payload admin (Settings group) with 7 tabs: Booking Received, Admin Notification, Booking Confirmed, Booking Declined, Payment Received, Pre-Tour Reminder, Footer.

## [1.25.2] - 2026-03-18

### Changed
- **Revert email logo to fonts** — reverted image-based logos back to web-safe font rendering (Georgia/Times New Roman) in all 6 email templates; images (external URL or base64) get blocked by Outlook until sender is trusted, fonts render immediately

## [1.25.1] - 2026-03-17

### Changed
- **Email logo as image** — replaced font-based "Best Prague Guide" text in all 6 email templates with locale-aware logo images (`logo-email-en.png` / `logo-email-ru.png`), ensuring consistent brand rendering across email clients

## [1.24.2] - 2026-03-16

## [1.23.5] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **`/api/fix-seo` endpoint** — generates missing metaTitle (from tour title), metaDescription (from excerpt, truncated to 160 chars), and sets ogImage from heroImage for all tours in both EN and RU locales

## [1.23.4] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed
- **Language switcher 404 on single-locale tours/blogs** — hreflang alternates are now only emitted when the content is published in the other locale; language switcher redirects to homepage instead of 404 when no translation exists

## [1.23.3] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed
- **Pricing info visible for all pricing models** — desktop sidebar and mobile booking modal now show pricing for PER_PERSON (€X per person), FLAT_RATE (€X per group), and ON_REQUEST tours, not only GROUP_TIERS

## [1.23.2] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed
- **Booking pricing description visibility** — pricing description text in desktop sidebar and mobile booking modal now only displays for tours with GROUP_TIERS pricing model, hidden for PER_PERSON, FLAT_RATE, and ON_REQUEST tours

## [1.23.1] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed
- **Tour order save fails in RU locale** — POST `/api/tour-order` now sends the active locale to `payload.update()`, preventing validation errors on RU-only tours that lack EN values for required fields (title, slug, excerpt, description)
- **Russian duration plural forms** — added `hoursLabel()` to `src/lib/plurals.ts` with correct 3-form Russian pluralization (1 час, 2–4 часа, 5+ часов) and fractional duration support (3.5 часа); tour detail page now uses it instead of a simple singular/plural check

## [1.23.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **Mobile booking modal parity with desktop** — mobile booking modal now shows pricing table (group tiers), pricing description, and additional services before the booking form, matching the desktop sidebar layout

## [1.22.9] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed
- **Restored booking trust badges** — re-seeded 3 EN trust badges via API, added RU locale fix to `/api/fix-richtext` endpoint to insert missing RU translations for trust badges without triggering Payload's localized array overwrite bug

## [1.22.8] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed
- **RichText fixed toolbar missing in admin** — `FixedToolbarFeatureClient` was not in `importMap.js`, so the formatting toolbar never rendered for fields using `fullEditor`; added manually to importMap and set global default editor in `payload.config.ts` to use `FixedToolbarFeature` with full feature set (bold, italic, underline, link, lists, headings, blockquote, horizontal rule)

## [1.22.7] - 2026-03-16

### Changed
- **About page text-justify** — added `text-justify` to founder bio section for consistent paragraph alignment

## [1.22.5] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed
- **Pages richText toolbar missing** — added `fullEditor` to the `content` field in Pages collection; was using default Lexical editor with no formatting toolbar (headings, lists, blockquotes, etc.)

## [1.22.4] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- **Admin panel crash on filtered-out documents** — removed `baseFilter` from Tours and Reviews collections; `baseFilter` blocks direct document access (e.g., `/admin/collections/tours/55`) when the document doesn't match the current locale, causing a client-side crash instead of showing the document

### Reverted
- **Tours/Reviews admin locale filtering** — `baseFilter` removed from both collections; all documents now visible regardless of admin locale (use column filters to narrow by locale)

## [1.22.3] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- **Reviews admin locale filtering** — `baseFilter` on Reviews collection filters admin list by `language` matching selected locale (EN shows only English reviews, RU shows only Russian)

## [1.22.2] - 2026-03-15

### Changed
- **Booking form labels** — "Preferred Time" → "Start Time" (EN), "Желаемое время" → "Время начала" (RU); "Количество гостей" → "Сколько вас будет человек" (RU)

## [1.22.1] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- **FAQ 42 missing RU translation** — added Russian translation for "Do you accept USD, EUR and card payments?" FAQ; previously showed English text on RU homepage due to Payload locale fallback
- **Review locale data** — fixed all 8 reviews to have proper EN and RU translations (title + body) via fix-schema endpoint

## [1.22.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- **Homepage review filtering by locale** — testimonials slider now shows only reviews matching the current locale (EN reviews for EN, RU reviews for RU)
- **`showOnHomepage` flag on Reviews** — new checkbox to control which reviews appear in the homepage testimonials slider (replaces `featured` in homepage query)

## [1.21.1] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- **Booking pricing description in CMS** — `bookingPricingDescription` localized textarea in SiteSettings → Booking tab; renders below pricing table in tour detail sidebar
- **Related tours relationship** — `relatedTours` hasMany self-relationship on Tours collection with fix-schema SQL for `tours_rels` and `_tours_v_rels` tables

## [1.21.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- **Booking trust badges editable from CMS** — trust badges ("No payment until we confirm", "Free cancellation 24h before", "100% private") moved from hardcoded i18n/static text to `bookingTrustBadges` array in SiteSettings → Booking tab; localized, user-editable from admin panel
- **SiteSettings Booking tab** — new tab in admin panel for booking-related settings

### Changed
- **Rate-limited phone uses SiteSettings** — booking form rate-limit phone number now uses `contactPhoneDisplay` from SiteSettings instead of hardcoded value
- **BookingModal trust badges from CMS** — mobile modal trust badges now receive data from SiteSettings instead of hardcoded EN/RU strings

## [1.20.6] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- **Media upload failing for images matching configured size ratios** — `position: 'focalpoint'` is not a valid Sharp resize position; when Payload's aspect-ratio-match path passes config directly to Sharp, it throws. Changed to `position: 'centre'`; Payload's focal point cropping is handled separately via `focalPoint: true` on the upload config

## [1.20.5] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- **Media upload failing** — added `libc6-compat` and `vips-dev` Alpine packages to Docker runner stage + explicitly copy Sharp native binaries (`@img/sharp-*`); standalone output doesn't trace dynamically-loaded native modules, causing image resizing to fail

### Changed
- **Media alt text optional** — `alt` field no longer required; defaults to humanized filename (e.g., `photo_prague_castle.jpg` → `photo prague castle`) via `beforeChange` hook

## [1.20.4] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- **Media upload failing** — Sharp native binaries (`@img/sharp-*`) were not included in the Docker runner stage; Next.js standalone output doesn't trace dynamically-loaded native modules, so images >= 400x300 that trigger Sharp resizing would fail with "There was a problem while uploading the file"

## [1.20.3] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- **About page plain text rendering** — `SafeRichText` now splits plain strings by newlines into separate `<p>` tags instead of rendering as one unformatted block

## [1.20.2] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- **About page Lexical editor error** — added about-page global support to `/api/fix-richtext` endpoint to convert plain-text `founderBio` and `teamDescription` fields to Lexical JSON format in `about_page_locales` table

## [1.20.1] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- **Homepage 500 error** — removed `onError` event handlers from Hero and TourCard server components; event handlers are not supported in React Server Components and caused RSC serialization errors on the homepage

## [1.20.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- **Viewport metadata** — `export const viewport` with `device-width`, `initialScale: 1`, `maximumScale: 5` for proper mobile scaling
- **Back-to-top button** — `BackToTop` component appears after 400px scroll, fixed at bottom-left, smooth-scrolls to top
- **Homepage FAQ schema** — FAQPage JSON-LD structured data on homepage FAQ section (was only on /faq page)
- **Noscript fallbacks** — bilingual "enable JavaScript" messages on booking and contact forms for progressive enhancement
- **Form autocomplete** — `autoComplete` hints (name, email, tel) on booking and contact form inputs for browser autofill

### Changed
- **Image priority optimization** — `priority` prop on GuideProfile photo and first 2 FeaturedTours category cards for faster LCP
- **Analytics lazy loading** — Umami and Yandex Metrika scripts changed from `afterInteractive` to `lazyOnload` to reduce FID blocking
- **Sitemap lastmod** — static pages use fixed date (`2026-03-15`) instead of `new Date()` for consistent crawl signals
- **Success auto-dismiss** — booking and contact form success messages auto-reset after 5 seconds

## [1.19.1] - 2026-03-15

### Security
- **Next.js 15.3.9 → 15.4.11** — fixes 3 CVEs: SSRF via middleware redirect (GHSA-4342), cache key confusion for Image Optimization (GHSA-g5qg), content injection for Image Optimization (GHSA-xv57)
- **immutable 4.3.7 → 4.3.8** — fixes prototype pollution (GHSA-wf6x, High severity)
- Remaining 11 alerts are transitive dependencies locked by Payload CMS ecosystem — will resolve with upstream Payload updates

## [1.19.0] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- **Dockerfile** — changed `NODE_ENV=development` to `NODE_ENV=production` in CMD, enabling production optimizations and CSP headers
- **TourSchema/BlogPostSchema** — replaced hardcoded `bestpragueguide.com` domain with `NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL` for staging/preview compatibility
- **Form accessibility** — added `aria-invalid` and `aria-describedby` on booking form fields (date, name, email) and contact form (message) for screen reader error association
- **Blog image alt text** — blog listing cards now use `heroImage.alt` from Media collection, falling back to post title
- **Nav accessibility** — hamburger button gets `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls="mobile-menu"`, and locale-aware `aria-label`; mobile menu panel gets `id="mobile-menu"`
- **Filter accessibility** — tour filter buttons now have `aria-pressed` to announce active state to screen readers
- **Image error fallback** — TourCard and Hero images hide gracefully on load failure via `onError` handler, revealing background placeholder

### Added
- **Blog ISR caching** — `revalidate = 3600` on blog listing page (was re-rendering every request)
- **Empty states** — tours grid shows "No tours found for this category" when filter returns zero results; blog already had this
- **Shared constants** — `src/lib/constants.ts` with `FALLBACK_IMAGES` replacing duplicated hardcoded photo URLs in Hero and GuideProfile
- **i18n keys** — `tour.share`, `booking.perPersonAbbr` added to both EN/RU message files; replaces last hardcoded locale ternaries

## [1.18.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- **Security headers** — CSP, X-Frame-Options (`SAMEORIGIN`), X-Content-Type-Options (`nosniff`), Referrer-Policy (`strict-origin-when-cross-origin`), Permissions-Policy (camera/microphone/geolocation disabled) via `async headers()` in next.config.ts
- **Loading skeletons** — `loading.tsx` with animate-pulse placeholders for tour detail and blog detail routes (Suspense-based streaming)
- **PWA manifest** — `public/manifest.json` with theme-color `#C4975C`, background `#FAF7F2`, standalone display mode; layout metadata updated with manifest link, apple icon, and theme-color meta tags

- **Server actions** — `src/app/actions/booking.ts` and `src/app/actions/contact.ts` replace client-side `fetch()` calls; BookingRequestForm and ContactForm now use server actions directly
- **Testing infrastructure** — Vitest setup with `@` path aliases; 62 unit tests (51 pricing engine + 11 email validation), all passing

### Changed
- **CMS type safety** — added `LexicalRichText`, `TourData`, `TourGalleryItem`, `TourListItem`, `TourFaqItem` interfaces in `src/lib/cms-types.ts`; removed all 18 `(tour as any)` casts from tour detail page
- **API caching headers** — `Cache-Control: public, s-maxage=60, stale-while-revalidate=120` on tour-order GET; `s-maxage=10, stale-while-revalidate=30` on health endpoint

## [1.17.1] - 2026-03-15

### Changed
- **Universal share button** — on mobile devices, ShareButtons uses the native Web Share API (opens OS share sheet with WhatsApp, Telegram, Instagram, and all installed apps); on desktop, falls back to individual buttons (WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook, Twitter/X, LinkedIn, copy link)

## [1.17.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- **Social share buttons** — new `ShareButtons` component (Facebook, Twitter/X, LinkedIn, copy link) on tour detail and blog post pages
- **Print-friendly styles** — `@media print` CSS hides nav/footer/sticky elements, optimizes layout for A4 printing
- **Redis rate limiting** — shared `src/lib/rate-limit.ts` using Redis sorted sets with sliding window; falls back to in-memory when `REDIS_URL` is unset
- **i18n `pages` namespace** — 23 new translation keys (EN/RU) covering all remaining hardcoded locale ternaries across about, blog, contact, FAQ, reviews, and tours pages
- **i18n `tour.perPerson` / `tour.perGroup`** — new keys for StickyBookButton price labels

### Changed
- **Blog detail ISR** — switched from `force-dynamic` to `revalidate=3600` (1-hour ISR) matching tour detail page caching strategy
- **StickyBookButton i18n** — replaced 5 hardcoded locale ternaries with `useTranslations` calls
- **ContactForm i18n** — replaced 4 hardcoded locale ternaries with `useTranslations('pages')` calls
- **Loading spinners** — booking and contact form submit buttons now show animated spinner during submission
- **WhatsApp button positioning** — increased mobile bottom offset (`bottom-24`) to prevent overlap with StickyBookButton

### Removed
- **Dead code cleanup** — removed unused `TourReviews` import, `getTourReviews` function, and `reviewCards` mapping from tour detail page

## [1.16.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- **Custom preferred times per tour** — optional `preferredTimes` select (hasMany) field on Tours collection allows setting specific available booking times (e.g., 16:00 and 20:00 only); when empty, default 9:00–18:00 range with 30-min steps is shown; time options range from 00:00 to 23:30

## [1.15.5] - 2026-03-14

### Fixed
- **Internal links in tour descriptions** — richText internal links (e.g., "замка Карлштейн" on Konopiste tour) now resolve to actual tour URLs instead of `href="#"`
  - Added `src/lib/richtext.ts` — server-side `resolveRichTextLinks()` walks Lexical JSON tree, batch-fetches doc slugs from Payload, populates link nodes
  - Tour detail page uses Payload's `RichText` component with custom `LinkJSXConverter` and `internalDocToHref` callback for locale-aware URLs
  - `SafeRichText` component updated to handle internal links for tours, blog-posts, and pages collections
- **Pricing tier display** — restored `maxGuests` values for non-last tiers across all 14 tours (were incorrectly cleared by the "Remove Max Group" migration, showing "1+, 4+, 8+, 13+" instead of "1-3, 4-7, 8-12, 13+")
  - Added `POST /api/fix-tier-maxguests` endpoint using SQL LEAD() window function to derive maxGuests from next tier's minGuests
  - Fixed 28 rows in main table, 148 in version table

## [1.8.7] - 2026-03-07

### Fixed
- **RU translation**: replaced "приватно/приватная" with "индивидуально/индивидуальная" across all files (i18n, booking modal, tour detail, seed data)

## [1.8.6] - 2026-03-07

### Fixed
- **Guide photo** on homepage — restored horizontal (4:3 landscape) aspect ratio while keeping 40:60 layout split

## [1.8.5] - 2026-03-07

- Temporary `fix-schema` API endpoint (no longer needed after DB columns were added)

## [1.8.1] - 2026-03-07

- Updated admin descriptions for guest categories to clarify they support any guest option (tickets, age categories, etc.)

## [1.8.0] - 2026-03-07

### Added

- **Guest category breakdown** in booking form — per-category counters with price modifiers (e.g., Junior +€10)
- Service and category selections included in booking request submission data

## [1.7.3] - 2026-03-07

### Fixed
- Guest selector now shows "X+ guests" as last option when last pricing tier has no upper cap, instead of listing individual numbers up to 20
- `getMaxGuests()` returns `minGuests` of open-ended last tier so dropdown ends with that value

## [1.7.2] - 2026-03-07

### Fixed
- `getMaxGuests()` default raised from 8 to 20 when last tier has no maxGuests and tour has no maxGroupSize — supports open-ended "5+ guests" tiers

## [1.7.1] - 2026-03-07

### Added
- Group tiers pricing table in tour detail sidebar — shows tier breakdown above booking form
- Additional services display in tour detail sidebar — shows service names with prices

## [1.7.0] - 2026-03-07

### Added
- **Flexible tour pricing system** — 4 pricing models: GROUP_TIERS, PER_PERSON, FLAT_RATE, ON_REQUEST
- `src/lib/pricing.ts` — shared pricing engine (`calculatePrice`, `getDisplayPrice`, `getMaxGuests`, `validateGuestBreakdown`)
- `src/collections/Services.ts` — new Services collection for reusable add-on services (entry tickets, vehicles, restaurants, etc.)
- `src/components/tours/PriceDisplay.tsx` — shared pricing display component (card, detail, sticky variants)
- `pricing` group on Tours collection with model selector, group tiers, per-person, flat rate, and on-request fields

- BookingRequestForm now uses `calculatePrice()` for dynamic pricing based on guest count
- BookingModal and StickyBookButton use `getDisplayPrice()` for price header
- TourCard uses `PriceDisplay` component instead of hardcoded `€{groupPrice}`
- TourSchema handles optional price (ON_REQUEST tours omit price from schema.org)
- Guest selector range is now dynamic based on `getMaxGuests()` instead of hardcoded 1-8
- Booking validation schema allows up to 50 guests (was hardcoded max 8)
- Notification formatters (Telegram, WhatsApp, Slack) show "On Request" for on-request bookings
- Seed script now populates new `pricing.model` and `pricing.groupTiers` fields alongside legacy `groupPrice`

### Fixed
- Production DB schema: manually created pricing tables via SQL migration (pushDevSchema hangs in prod)
- Array table `id` columns changed from `serial` (integer) to `varchar` — Payload 3.x generates string ObjectIds for array rows, causing "invalid input syntax for type integer" on save
- Missing `_uuid` column on all Payload 3.x array tables (required for row tracking)
- Missing `service_id` column on `tours_pricing_additional_services` and version table
- Missing `services_id` on `payload_locked_documents_rels` (required for new Services collection)
- Migrated all 21 existing tours from legacy `groupPrice` to `GROUP_TIERS` pricing model with group tier rows

### Deprecated
- `groupPrice` and `groupSurchargePercent` fields on Tours collection (kept as hidden fields for backward compatibility)

## [1.6.4] - 2026-03-07

### Added
- Comprehensive implementation plan for flexible tour pricing system (`docs/plans/2026-03-07-tour-pricing-configuration.md`)
